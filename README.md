## About
Cleaner Coasts is a collaboration between Laura Rivera, John Rivera and Julia Wey. After attending a volunteer mixer with the local Long Island chapters of The Surfrider Foundation, Laura and Julia thought of an application that could support beach cleanups. Surfrider works to collect data on the amounts and types of trash that are collected on local beaches to inform law makers and advocate for policy to protect our oceans and beaches. We hope to use this app to streamline data collection and further support the work of Surfrider and all protectors of the oceans.
