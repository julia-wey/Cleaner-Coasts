## About
Cleaner Coasts is a collaboration between Laura Rivera, Julia Wey and John Rivera. After attending a volunteer mixer with the local Long Island chapters of The Surfrider Foundation, Laura and Julia thought of an application that could support beach cleanups. Surfrider works to collect data on the amounts and types of trash that are collected on local beaches to inform law makers and advocate for policy to protect our oceans and beaches. Laura, Julia and John collaborated to envision and design a clean and intuitive user experience and interface. We hope to use this application to streamline data collection and further support the work of Surfrider and all protectors of the oceans.
